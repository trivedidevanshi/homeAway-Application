### HOMEAWAY  

## Lab 1
Implemented a 3-tier distributed architecture: The presentation layer includes modules such as traveler, user profile, user’s travel log, property owner and property booking developed in React JS, HTML5, Bootstrap, CSS. The application layer processes user request and creates a sql query for the same which is developed in Node JS. The data layer or the database uses MySQL Db.

## Lab 2
Used Connection Pooling optimization technique to process multiple user request in NodeJS. Migrated to MongoDb database and used Kafka messaging queue to improve performance and horizontal scalability. 
Added pagination, filters and search features. Deployed the website on an Amazon EC2 T2 type instance.

## Lab 3
Moved from REST Api to GraphQL query language for API to gain advantage of features provided by it like: no under and over fetching issues, enabling rapid product iterations at the frontend, gaining insightful data analysis at the backend and predefined schema benefits, using queries and mutations.
